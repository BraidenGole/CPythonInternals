Using Instaviz to View Abstract Syntax trees:
  
  (Windows 10 Command)
  To install instaviz: `python -m pip install instaviz`
  
  Then open up REPL by typing "python" at the command prompt
  now type the following program.
  
  def example():
    a = 1
    b = a + 1
    return b
    
  instaviz.show(example)
  
  NOTE: In my case I had to install "pyreadline" as well to get this going
  but only do so if prompted !
