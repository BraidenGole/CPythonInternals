Why (CPython) is written in the C programming language and not Python?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
When we look at the word "CPython" you most likely are thinking that this
is a distribution of Python that is written in the C programming language.

It would be fair to say that this is correct because the compiler is writen
in pure C but many of the standard library modules are written in pure Python
or a mix of C and Python.

This is only part of the question the other part would be based
on how compilers work altogether.

There are two types of compilers.

  1. Self-hosted compilers: Are compilers written in the language they compile
     such as Go compiler. This is done by a process called "Bootstrapping"
     
  2. Source-to-source compilers: Are compilers written in another language that
     already has a compiler.
  
If you wanted to write your own programming language, then you would need
an executable application to compile your compiler. A compiler is needed to
execute anything, so when new languages are often developed, they are first
written in an older more stable language.
