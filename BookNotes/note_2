Why (CPython) is written in the C programming language and not Python?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
When we look at the word "CPython" you most likely are thinking that this
is a distribution of Python that is written in the C programming language.

It would be fair to say that this is correct because the compiler is writen
in pure C but many of the standard library modules are written in pure Python
or a mix of C and Python.

This is only part of the question the other part would be based
on how compilers work altogether.

There are two types of compilers.
