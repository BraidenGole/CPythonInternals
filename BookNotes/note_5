The wchar_t* type is used as a low level storage type for unicode data across CPython since
the size of the type can store UTF-8 characters.

When converting wchar_t* to a Python string, the objects > unicodeobject.c file has a 
helper function, PyUnicode_FromWideChar(), that returns a unicode string. The actual encoding
is done by PyUnicode_AsUTF8String()

once that is complete the pymain_run_command() passes the Python bytes object to 
PyRun_SimpleStringFlags() for execution.

Input with a local module:

  CPython imports a standard library module, runpy, and executes it using PyObject_Call()
  The import is done using hte C API function PyImport_ImportModule() found within the file
  called import.c
  
 In Python if you have an object and would like to retrieve an attribute from that class
 then we can use the assistance of getattr(). The near equivalent is PyObject_GetAttrString().
