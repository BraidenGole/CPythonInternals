The wchar_t* type is used as a low level storage type for unicode data across CPython since
the size of the type can store UTF-8 characters.

When converting wchar_t* to a Python string, the objects > unicodeobject.c file has a 
helper function, PyUnicode_FromWideChar(), that returns a unicode string. The actual encoding
is done by PyUnicode_AsUTF8String()

once that is complete the pymain_run_command() passes the Python bytes object to 
PyRun_SimpleStringFlags() for execution.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Input with a local module:

  CPython imports a standard library module, runpy, and executes it using PyObject_Call()
  The import is done using hte C API function PyImport_ImportModule() found within the file
  called import.c
  
 In Python if you have an object and would like to retrieve an attribute from that class
 then we can use the assistance of getattr(). The near equivalent is PyObject_GetAttrString().
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Input from a script file or standard input:
  
  If the first argument given to Python is a filename, for example test.py, then CPython will
  open a file handle and pass the handle to PyRun_SimpleExFlags() inside of Python > pythonrun.c
  
  There are three paths that the function can take base on the input supplied:
    
    1. If the argument supplied is a .pyc file, then it will invoke run_pyc_file()
    2. If the file path is a script file .py, then it will run PyRun_FileExFlags()
    3. If the file path is sdin becuase the user <command> | python, then treat 
       stdin as a file handle and run PyRun_FileExFlags().
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Input form compiled bytecode:

  If we take PATH #1 then instead of loading the file as plain text to then be parsed CPython
  will make the assumption that the .pyc file contains a code object written to disk.
  
  In PyRun_SimpleFileExFlags(), there is a clause for the user providing a file path to a .pyc file.
  
  run_pyc_file() which is inside of Python > pythonrun.c "marshals" the code object from the .pyc file
  using the file handle.
  
  The code object data structure is the CPythons compilers way to cache compiled code so that it doesn't
  need to exhaustedly parse the file everytime the script is invoked.
  
  [Marshaling]: Is a term for copying the contents of a file into memory and converting them
                to a specific data structure.
