The unique thing about CPython is that it contains both runtime and the shared language specification.
CPython is the official, or reference implementation of Python.

[Profile Guided Optimization] (PGO): Mac, Linux, and Windows build processes that have flags for PGO.
PGO is not a feature of Python but rather a feature that many compilers include.

PGO works by doing a initial compilation, then profiling the application by running a series of tests.
The profile is analyzed and the comiler makes changes to the binary that improve performace.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Function Inlining]: When a function is called from another function, then it will be inlined, or copied
into the calling function to reduce stack size.

[Virtual call speculation and Inlining]: If the call of a virtual function frequently targets a certain
function, then the PGO can insert a direct call to that function, then the direct call can now be inlined.

[Register allocation optimization]: Based on profile data results, the PGO will optimize register allocation.

[Basic block optimization]: Basic block optimization allows for a block of code to temporally execute within
a given frame to be placed in the same "locality".

[Hot spot optimization]: Programs that have functions that spend most of the execution time
can be optimized for speed.

[Function layout optimization]: Functions that tend to be along the same path of
execution are moved to the same section of the compiled application.

[Conditional branch optimization]: The profile guided optimization can make decisions
just like an if, else if, else, or switch statement. What this does is it spots the most
commonly used path such as if I had a switch statement with 10 cases and case 1 was being
used 85% of the time then that case will be moved up to the top so that the code is executed
immediately.

[Dead spot separation]: Source code that does not get called during the process of profile
guided optimization is moved to a different part of the application.
