Symbol Tables

  Before the code is compiled a symbol table is created by PySymtable_BuildObject() API.
  
  The purpose of the symbol table is to provide a list of namespaces, globals, and locals
  for the compiler to use for referencing and resolving scopes.

  Source Files:
  
    Python > symtable.c
    Include > symtable.h
    Lib > symtable.py

The symtable structure should be one symtable instance for the compiler, namespacing is essential.

If we define a function called hello_world() in one class and declare the same thing in another we
have to be sure that we know which one is being called inside the module.

The symbol table ensures that variables declared within a narrow scope don't automatically become globals.
