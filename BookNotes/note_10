Symbol Tables

  Before the code is compiled a symbol table is created by PySymtable_BuildObject() API.
  
  The purpose of the symbol table is to provide a list of namespaces, globals, and locals
  for the compiler to use for referencing and resolving scopes.

  Source Files:
  
    Python > symtable.c
    Include > symtable.h
    Lib > symtable.py

The symtable structure should be one symtable instance for the compiler, namespacing is essential.

If we define a function called hello_world() in one class and declare the same thing in another we
have to be sure that we know which one is being called inside the module.

The symbol table ensures that variables declared within a narrow scope don't automatically become globals.

The symbol data structure symtable has the following fields:
  
  Field                   Type                  Purpose
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  recursion_depth         int                   Current recursion depth
  recursion_limit         int                   Recursion limit before RecursionError is raised.
  st_blocks               PyObject * (dict)     Map of AST node addresses to symol table entries.
  
  st_cur                  _symtable_entry       Current symbol table entry.
  st_filename             PyObject * (str)      Name of the file being compiled.
  st_future               PyFutureFeatures      Module's future features that affect the symbol table.
  
  st_global               PyObject * (dict)     Reference to the symbols in st_top.
  st_nblocks              int                   Number of blocks used.
  st_private              PyObject * (str)      Name of current class.
  st_stack                PyObject * (list)     Stack of namespace information.
  st_top                  _symtable_entry       Symbol table entry for the module.
