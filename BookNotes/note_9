The compiler:

  After the parsing the interpreter has an AST with the operations, functions, classes
  and namespaces of Python code.
  
  The job for the comiler is to turn the AST data structure into instructons that the
  CPU can understand.
  
  The compilation process is split up into two components:
    
    1. Compiler: traverse the AST data structure and create a control flow graph
       CFG, which will represent the logical sequence of execution.

    2. Assembler: Convert the nodes in the CFG to sequential, executable statements
       known as bytecode.
       
 It is very important to remember that the unit of compilation for CPython is a module.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 PyAST_CompileObject() is the main entry point to the CPythons compiler, it takes the
 Python AST module as an argument with the name of the file plus the globals, locals, and
 PyArena all instantiated earlier in the interpreter process.
 
  Source Files:
    
    Python > compile.c
    Include > compile.h

Terms:

  The [compiler state] is implemented as a container type, which contains one symbol table.
  
  The symbol table contains many [variable names] and can optionally contain child symbol tables.
  
  The compiler type contains many [compiler units].
  
  Each compiler unit can contain many names, varibale names, constants, and cell variables.
  
  A compiler unit contains many [basic frame blocks].
  
  Basic frame blocks contain many [bytecode instructions].
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Instantiating the compiler:

  A global compiler state is created before the compiler starts. The compiler state
  (compiler type) structure contains properties used by the compiler, the compiler flags
  the stack and PyArena.
  
  The compiler state is instantiated inside PyAST_CopmileObject()
  
  PyAST_CompileObject() sets the passed value as the compiler state filename, which is used
  to track traces and exceptions.
  
  Note:
  The memory allocation areana for the copmiler is set to the one used by the interpreter.
