To execute any Python code, the interpreter needs three things to be in place they are:
  
  1. A module to execute.
  2. A state to hold information such as variables.
  3. A configuration, such as which options are enabled.

When the above three things are provided Python can then execute the code and
give the result.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Configuration State:

  Before we can execute any Python code CPython runtime first establishes the
  configuration of the runtime and any user provided options.
  
  1. PyPreConfig, is used for preinitialization configuration.
  2. PyConfig, is used for the runtime configuration.
  3. The compiled configuration of the CPython interpreter.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Preinitialization and Configuration:

  PyPreConfig has three primary functions:
    
    1. Setting the Python memory allocator.
    2. Configuring the LC_CTYPE locale to the system.
    3. Encoding the character set UTF-8.
    
    PyPreConfig contains the following fields all of type int:
    
    allocator: Select a memory allocator, such as PYMEM_ALLOCATOR_MALLOC.
    configure_locale: Set the LC_CTYPE locale.
    ceorce_c_locale: If equal to 2, then coerce the C locale. If equal to 1,
                     then read the LC_CTYPE locale to decide if it should be coerced.
    ceorce_c_locale_warn: If nonzero, then emit a warning if the C locale is coerced.
    dev_mode: Turn on developmment mode.
    isolated: Enable isolated mode.
    legacy_windows_fs_encoding: (Windows only) If nonzero, then disable UTF-8 mode and
                                set the python file system encoding to "mbcs."
    parse_argv: If nonzero, then use command-line arguments.
    use_environment: If greater than zerom then use environment variables.
    utf8_mode: If nonzero, then enable UTF-8 mode.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Runtime Configuration Data Structure (Second stage)

  The runtime configuration can be set in different ways it has different levels of
  precendence, the following below are the steps to verbose mode.
  
  Verbose mode:
  
    1. The default value for config->verbose is hardcoded to -1 in the source code.
    2. The evironment variable PYTHONVERBOSE is used to set the value of config-verbose
    3. If the environment variable does not exist, then the default value will remain -1.
    4. In config_parse_cmdline() within Python>initconfig.c, the command-line flag is used
       to set the value if provided.
    5. This value is copied to a global variable PyVerboseFlag by _Py_GetGlobalVariablesAsDict()
    
Order of precendence:
  
  1. System configuration.
  2. Command-line arguments.
  3. Environment variables.
  4. PyPreConfig.
  5. PyConfig.
  6. Runtime.
